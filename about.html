    <h4>HISTORY</h4>
    <p>
      When SYN Rent a Car began its operations in 2016, the very concept of hiring cars was novel to Ethiopia. The few cars that were seen on the roads were either owned by affluent Addis or by companies that had a presence in the country.

SYNM was the right choice for these value-conscious customers with its experienced and trained manpower and a fleet of well- maintained cars available round the clock, 365 days a year.

The emphasis SYN placed on very high levels of personalized serviced earned the company the ISO 9001 certification besides several awards and recognitions including the MENA Travel award for the years 2017,2018 and 2019 for being the best car rental brand in the entire Middle East and North Africa by C.H.A International. We have also won the prestigious Trade Leaders Club Award in 2020 and the International Quality Crown Award by BID World Congress in 2020. 

Our fleet includes SUVs, Minivans, Vans, 15- and 7-Seater Micro Vans and Luxury buses/coaches with a seating capacity of 66, 45, 42, 34, 29 and 26. The 42-seater Super Luxury Coach with a lavatory is one of its kinds in Doha and is a popular choice among schools for their field trips and excursions.
